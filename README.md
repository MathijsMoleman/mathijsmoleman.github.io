# Projects
Project Frontiers 

Project Frontiers is a school project where we had to make a game with a group of students. We tried to make a fun escape room inside of a castle that you needed to escape from an evil wizard. In this project I was a programmer and made the user interface mechanics, made some puzzle mechanics, helped my other engineer with code if he didn’t came out of how to do something and he helped me if I didn’t come out of something. We worked really well together.
