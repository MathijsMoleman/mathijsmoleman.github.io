A second year Game and Graphics Engineer and also an 3D artist student at Creative media and Game Technologies Saxion University of Applied Sciences

# About Me
Hi, I am Mathijs Moleman. I am a CMGT student at Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I focus on game and graphical engineering, with additional experience in 3D art. I work on interactive systems, gameplay mechanics, and visual assets through hands on projects. I aim to grow into a professional game developer within the game industry

# Projects
## Project Frontiers 

Project Frontiers is a school project where we had to make a game with a group of students. We tried to make a fun escape room inside of a castle that you needed to escape from an evil wizard. In this project I was a programmer and made the user interface mechanics, made some puzzle mechanics, helped my other engineer with code if he didn’t came out of how to do something and he helped me if I didn’t come out of something. We worked really well together.

For this projecet i had to write a algorithem that will generade a random dungeon with any heigt and with combination. It also had to come with a player that could navigate the dungeon
### What I Learned

- What algorithems are.
- Visual debugging.
- What Hashsets, Queues and dictionaries are.
- How A* and Dijkstra Work.
- How BFS, DFS, Flood Fill and Martching Squares work and implement them.
- What Big O notation is and the Time Complexity of an algorithem.
